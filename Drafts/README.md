## Drafts of Final Thesis Product

There will be multiple notebook files:

<ol>
    <li>Create visualizations via ipysigma, which will allow for the user to click on pairs of dots and get metrics (like similarity scores). 
        A more advanced version would also include hyperlinks to the visualized protein. But if not, at least return the relative indices, with which to go into PyMol and get the slice. Or, pull from the precomputed html files. </li>
    <li>Cluster via DBSCAN algorithm, and provide analysis for selecting good parameters (i.e. radius and min samples).</li>
    <li>Cluster via Sklearn algorithm, and provide silhouette score analysis, and others, for clustering here as well.</li>
    <li>Additional helper files to calculate edges, and compute scores, etc.</li>
</ol>
